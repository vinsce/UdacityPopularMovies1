Project Popular Movies Stage 1 for the Associate Android Developer Fast Track

### TMDb API Key setting
The app requires a [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org) API Key in order to get movies information.
The app is configured to read the API Key from a string resource named *api_key* so just add a new string in *res/values/strings.xml*:
```xml
<string name="api_key">YOUR API KEY HERE</string>
```
